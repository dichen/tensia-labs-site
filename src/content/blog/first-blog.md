### Welcome to Tensia Labs

Welcome to the Tensia Labs blog.

As a seasoned electronic engineer for years and now working as technical marketing for semiconductor firm, I am always passionate about using latest technologies to address the real world engineering problems.

At Tensia Labs, we focus on engineering solutions to streamlize workflow for product design, test and manufacturing.

We will use this blog to share our progress on the projects that we are developing.
