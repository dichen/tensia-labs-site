## Tensia Labs

Tensia Labs builds software foundations that let engineers visualize, control, and trust real-time systems—across web, desktop, and embedded environments.

Modern engineering systems generate real-time data, but most tools were never designed to display it accurately or reliably.

[Tensia Instruments](/product) provides hardware-faithful UI components including
* seven-segment displays
* LED Indicators
* Analog gauges
* switches
* Integrated Control panels
* Built for live telemetry and instrumentation automation workflows.
