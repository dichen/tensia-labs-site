## Tensia Labs

Tensia Labs builds software foundations that let engineers visualize, control, and trust real-time systems—across web, desktop, and embedded environments.

[Tensia Instruments](/product) is a real-time web HMI runtime and signal interface, designed to give industrial teams WPF/Qt-like reliability on the web—complete with buffering/replay, deterministic updates, and safe two-way control—plus a focused set of industrial UI components and an optional panel builder.
